READ ALGORITHM

1. Decode the read address into a one-hot signal
2. Send the 32-bit decoded signal to the 32 rows of the CAM memory (1 bit per row)
3. If it is a negative clock edge
	a. If the address bit is a 1 and the read enable signal is 1, output the data stored in the flip-flops
	b. Otherwise output a zero
4. Feed data output of all rows to the mux
5. Use the read_index_i input to select the proper row to output

WRITE ALGORITHM

1. Decode the write address into a one-hot signal
2. Send the 32-bit decoded signal to the 32 rows of the CAM memory (1 bit per row) 
3. If it is a positive clock edge
	a. If the address bit is 1 and the write enable signal is 1, copy the data in value to the flip flops
	b. Otherwise hold the current value

SEARCH ALGORITHM

1. Feed the search signal and key to all rows of the CAM memory
2. If it is a negative clock edge
	a. If the search signal is 1
		i. Check if the stored value equals the key. If so, output 1. Otherwise, output 0.
3. Send the match signal from each row (a 32-bit signal) into a priority encoder to convert it to an address
	a. If the 32-bit match signal is equal to 0, set the search_valid output to 0, otherwise 1.
	b. Priority encode the address based on the 32-bit match signal as input.
